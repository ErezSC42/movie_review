Amazon movie review challenge
The purpose of the challenge is to predict human written movie reviews' score (1 - 5)
I have attempted 2 approaches:
  classifaction - ignoring the score's order relation and treating it as a pure classification
  regression - modeling the score as a numerical value, and predicting it using a regression model
I have chosen to implement a TextCNN architecture in order to accomplish the task.As mentioned before, it was implemented twice; classifcation and regression model
